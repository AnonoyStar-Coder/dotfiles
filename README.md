## üöÄ Getting Started ‚Äî Unleash the Power of NixOS

> *Warning: Use at your own risk. May cause extreme customization and excessive pride.*

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnonoyStar-Coder/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Customize (Important!)**:
    Before applying, **please review and modify** the configurations to suit your specific needs. At a minimum, you'll want to change the username and any hardware-specific settings in `configuration.nix` and `home.nix`.

3.  **Apply the Configuration**:
    ```bash
    sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#your-hostname # Replace 'your-hostname' with your actual hostname
    ```
    *(If you don't have a specific hostname defined in your flake, you can use `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`)*

4.  **Reboot**:
    ```bash
    reboot
    ```
    After rebooting, your system should be running with the new NixOS configuration!
